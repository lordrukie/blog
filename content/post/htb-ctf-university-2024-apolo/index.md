#### FlowiseAI Exploit

I add the subdomain into `/etc/hosts` and starting to access the site. It seems like it use `FlowiseAI`.

It seems that `FlowiseAI` have [authentication bypass vulnerability](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/52001).

using the technique mentioned on the exploitdb, i managed to bypsas authentication and obtain credentials id.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "6cfda83a-b055-4fd8-a040-57e5f1dae2eb",
    "name": "MongoDB",
    "credentialName": "mongoDBUrlApi",
    "createdDate": "2024-11-14T09:02:56.000Z",
    "updatedDate": "2024-11-14T09:02:56.000Z"
  }
]
```

The id can be used to read the value of mongodb creds.

```json
{
  "id": "6cfda83a-b055-4fd8-a040-57e5f1dae2eb",
  "name": "MongoDB",
  "credentialName": "mongoDBUrlApi",
  "createdDate": "2024-11-14T09:02:56.000Z",
  "updatedDate": "2024-11-14T09:02:56.000Z",
  "plainDataObj": {
    "mongoDBConnectUrl": "mongodb+srv://lewis:C0mpl3xi3Ty!_W1n3@cluster0.mongodb.net/myDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
  }
}
```

There's pair of credentials there, which is `lewis:C0mpl3xi3Ty!_W1n3`.

The credentials can be used to logged in using ssh.

## Root

Our current user have permission to run `rclone` as root using sudo.

Unfortunately, `rclone` is not listed in GTFOBins site
![](image-10.png)

Then i try to check for it's docouomentation, and found that it have `cat` options that can be used to read files.

I can easily read root flag using following command.
